## ü©∫ Project 1: Heart Disease Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning project to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This project emphasizes data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation crucial in a critical domain like healthcare.

### üéØ Goal

To build a highly accurate classification model that can predict a patient's risk of heart disease based on clinical features.

### üíæ Dataset

  * **Source:** [Specify your dataset source, e.g., **Cleveland UCI Heart Disease Dataset**]
  * **Key Features:** [List 3-4 important clinical features, e.g., Age, Chest Pain Type, Cholesterol, Max Heart Rate, etc.]

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Methodology

| Category | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tech Stack** | **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib** |
| **Algorithms Used** | **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, [Other Model] |
| **Evaluation Metrics** | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC |

### ‚ú® Key Result

  * **Best Model:** [Specify your best-performing model, e.g., **Random Forest Classifier**]
  * **Achieved Accuracy:** **[State your highest accuracy score, e.g., 90.1%]**

## üçø Project 2: Netflix Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)

A comprehensive data exploration of the Netflix content catalog to uncover viewing patterns, content distribution, and platform characteristics.

### üéØ Goal

To perform detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visualization to reveal insights into Netflix's content strategy, popular genres, and global trends.

### üíæ Dataset

  * **Source:** [Specify your dataset source, e.g., **Kaggle: Netflix Movies and TV Shows**]
  * **Content:** Information on movies and TV shows, including genre, release year, cast, and ratings.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Methodology

| Category | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tech Stack** | **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** |
| **Analysis Focus** | Content Type Split (Movie vs. TV Show), Release Trends over time, Top Directors/Actors, Genre Popularity. |

### ‚ú® Key Findings

  * **Finding 1:** [Summarize your most interesting finding, e.g., "The platform has shown a **40% increase** in TV Show additions over the last 5 years."]
  * **Finding 2:** [Summarize a second key finding, e.g., "**International Movies** and **Dramas** dominate the content library."]

## üíª Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these projects locally, you need **Python 3.x** and the required data science libraries.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubUsername]/Dynamix-Network.git
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is highly recommended to use the list of packages specified in your requirements file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If you don't have a `requirements.txt`, use the list of libraries you installed, e.g., `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn jupyter`)*

### Running the Notebooks

1.  **Navigate** to the repository folder:
    ```bash
    cd Dynamix-Network
    ```
2.  **Launch** Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  Open the following files to view the full analysis:
      * **Heart Disease Prediction:** `[Folder Name, e.g., Heart-Disease-Prediction/heart_disease_model.ipynb]`
      * **Netflix Analysis:** `[Folder Name, e.g., Netflix-EDA/netflix_trends_analysis.ipynb]`
